# Clean Your Room

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently all of the functions work and the tests all pass, however, there are no unit tests for most of the functions and the test for `calculateProductPrice` is asserting return values but not that they are being calculated by the correct functions in the correct order. You should refactor the test suite to conform to testing best practices.

## Provided Files

**.babelrc** - this file allows mocha to read the code files written in ES6 syntax

**.eslintrc.js** - this file tells ESLint what our style rules are for our code so we will be prompted if we violate that style

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**pricing.js** - this file contains the functions for calculating the monthly price of a product based on a users enrollment options

**tests/employee.js** - this file contains test data used when running tests, specifically an example employee

**tests/products.js** - this file contains test data used when running tests, specifically example benefits products

**tests/tests.js** - this file contains tests for the functions in the `calculateProductPrice` function

## Exercise Submission

You should fork this repository and submit your working changes in a pull request to your forked repo.
